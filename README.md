## AI Capabilities

### Correlation Analysis
```
"Your heart rate variability improves by 15% when you get 7+ hours of sleep. 
This correlation is stronger on weekends when stress levels are lower."
```

### Predictive Insights
```
"Based on current training intensity, your VO2 max will likely reach 52.1 
within 6 weeks. Consider adding interval training twice weekly."
```

### Anomaly Detection
```
"Your resting heart rate has been 15% higher than usual for 3 consecutive days. 
This previously correlated with periods of high stress in your data."
```

### Personalized Recommendations
```
"Drinking 250ml water 45 minutes before workouts could improve your performance 
by 12% based on your sweat rate analysis."
```
